Dear DPAL users, in the past month, thanks to your support, the DPAL community has developed rapidly, and the DPAL wallet has continued to iterate and made great progress. Thank you for your support over the past month.
Recently, there have been some disputes in the community. Our management team has been listening to the opinions of the community. We held a communication meeting in the space last night and fully absorbed the opinions of all parties.
In order to further eliminate misunderstandings and allow the drc20 protocol to have more room for development, we have decided to:

1. Open the dpal wallet transfer function at 5:00 p.m. Beijing time
2. Develop a full-chain index, that is, after March 1, all data on the drc20 chain will be included in the index and displayed in the wallet, but the development will take about a week, 
and you can refer to the third-party index platform in the short term.
3. The wallet will increase the upper limit of mint, and will open the function of printing inscriptions in batches at a later stage
4. We have decided to reward all group members who care about the development of the dpal community: From 24:00 on June 4th to 24:00 on June 30th, 
the inscription mint fee will be reduced to 0.1doge/piece
5. All major project parties are welcome to contact the dpal team directly, and we will provide full support at the technical level.
6. Set up an English service team to serve foreign project parties and player committees
7. The API interface is open, and major exchanges, application wallets, and market teams are welcome to connect
8. Warmly invite major OTC teams to settle in, promote the establishment of the drc20 OTC committee, and create a fair and convenient trading environment for buyers and sellers
9. Launch the official push and forum as soon as possible, actively absorb the opinions of community members and accelerate product iteration.

We know that the members of the DPAL community have put in a lot of hard work in the past month, 
and the team has also received great support. It is with your support that the project can develop rapidly.
Grow into the largest community of the drc20 protocol. 
We always put the interests of dpal users first, and we will do our best to maintain the potential value of all the inscriptions cast by players in the past month.
A single tree does not make a forest, and a single string does not make a sound. 
We know that openness, tolerance, and cooperation are beneficial to all players. 
We also appeal here, The DPAL team is open to all-round cooperation with other teams in technology, business, 
protocol upgrades, etc. Let us work together to promote DRC20 to a higher level.

In response to the urgent needs of community members for open transfer, the team will open the transfer function from 5pm on June 4. However, 
since the DPAL community chooses to embrace the full-chain index, and the official existing index of DPAL needs to be modified,
The website and wallet only support indexing May dogi in the short term. In order to ensure the interests of dpal wallet users, we have made May dogi anti-sybilization and can transfer and balance inquiries through our index website normally.
For other full-index balances and ticks in March, please use a third-party index in the short term. The DPAL team will launch a full-chain index within a week, so stay tuned. In order to solve the problem of the same name between March dogi and May dogi,
After extensive solicitation of opinions and careful consideration, it was decided to separately display dogi in May as "dogim" in the wallet list, and give "dogim" holders priority privileges such as voting rights in the dpal community, whitelists, and early function opening rights. 
Please look forward to the details.

For the turmoil in the past few days, some project parties including the @owls_drc20 owl team have had some misunderstandings, we are deeply disturbed and remorseful,
The prosperity of the drc20 ecology is inseparable from the DPAL wallet, and it is even more inseparable from the hard work of the project party. 
We will continue to strengthen technical cooperation with major project parties,We fully support friends from all corners of the country to take root in dpal.
